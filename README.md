SchemaRegistryDemo
------------------

This is a demo created for MelbJVM on 7th August 2019

At this meetup event we embarked on a live coding exercise to demonstrate producing and consuming
data from Apache Kafka and evolved the schema to demonstrate how this is tracked in Schema Registry.

This was a live coding demonstration, this means:
* There is NO comments in this code
* There are NO tests in this code

As such this is not suitable for development or production use. It's intended purpose is for training and education only.
